# Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are always welcome - just open an issue or PR.
Please be aware that even though it may not seem like it there are always other humans on the other end of a conversation.

**Please treat others with respect and kindness.**

When contributing code, please run psalm and phpcs
in order to check for typing issues & code style violations.
Both of these can be bundled into one by running `composer analyze`.
