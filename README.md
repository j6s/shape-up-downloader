# Shape up downloader

## What does it do?
This is a simple CLI application that downloads [basecamps excellent free shape up book](https://basecamp.com/shapeup)
into a single, self-contained HTML file.
* uses base64 images
* uses document-internal links
* only the bare minimum of CSS

## Why does this exist?
The book is currently available in an HTML format, where every chapter is one document and a PDF document where all
chapters are in one self-contained file. While reading the book I was yearning for a way to read it on my e-book reader,
but reading PDF on a Kindle sucks and converting PDFs to epub or mobi is wonky at best. The software used to generate
this particular PDF combined some character combination (e.g. "tf") into a single UTF-8 codepoint with ligatures. This
however trips up most converting software.

Thus, this project was born to download and combine all web documents into a single self-contained file without styling.
You are not intended to read the book in that HTML format - but it can be used as a basis for further conversion steps.

To convert the file into more useful formats I recommend using calibres `ebook-convert` utility:
```bash
$ ebook-convert shape-up.html shape-up.epub \
    --authors "Ryan Singer" \
    --title "Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters" \
    --book-producer "Basecamp" \
    --publisher "Basecamp" \
    --language "en"
```

## Where can I download this HTML/EPUB/MOBI single page version?
I am not quite sure about the legal implications of hosting these files - thus I am not doing it.
The code to download it yourself is here, but you must use it yourself.

## Usage

1. [Install PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php)
2. [Install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
3. Run `php composer.phar install` (or `composer install` in case composer is installed globally)
4. Run `php cli.php download:single-html`

This will create a `shape-up.html` file in your current directory.
That's it.

## Docker way

There is a way to not deal with php at all. For that it is enough to have docker engine installed.

Usage
```
docker build -t shapeup .
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/output:/app/output shapeup epub
```
On the go it downloads singe html and converts it to the format chosen. All the available formats are there https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/generated/en/ebook-convert.html. The approach has been tested with azw3, fb2 and epub options
